- Enemies
    - Create instance of enemy movement reachable by all enemies
    - Create modes (AI and Pathfinder)
    - Pathfinding
        - Implement path finding based on distance to exit
            - assign each square a cardinal direction opposing their parent
            - make path go around towers
        - Create refresh on map changes
        - Make enemies movement
            - Base movement on distance to the center of each square
            - Create hard collisions with towers to prevent clipping
            - Create soft collisions with other enemies to prevent mimicking
            - Make enemies spawn at a random height (until rounds are predefined)
        - Allow pathfinding to break through towers
        - Allow enemies to break towers
            - Give enemies damage
            - Give towers health
            - Create destroy tower method
            - Make enemies damage towers if they intend to pass through
        - Allow path finding to account for tower health
    - AI
    // IDEA 1 //
        - Make enemies start doing random things
        - Make more future enemies mimick the enemy who traveled furthest before them
    // IDEA 2 //
        - Give enemies vision and move towards opening they see
        - Make them break towers instead of backtracking
    // IDEA 3 //
        - Simulate different algorithms of enemy movement before the round starts
        - Make the enemies use the algorithm that did the best off screen
